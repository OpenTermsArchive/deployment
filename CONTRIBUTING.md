### Changelog

All changes to the codebase that impact users must be documented in the [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

The format to use is [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org), with the following additional specifications:

1. The `unreleased` section of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) is preserved with the addition of a tag to specify which type of release should be published and to foster discussions about it inside pull requests. This tag should be one of the names mandated by SemVer, within brackets: `[patch]`, `[minor]` or `[major]`. For example: `## Unreleased [minor]`.
2. Each listed change must provide an actionable way to adapt the user‚Äôs codebase, either directly in the changelog or through instructions or links.
3. Changes are a single sentence with no punctuation (like all examples given in Common Changelog).
4. Since each release is produced automatically from a single pull request, the [notice](https://common-changelog.org/#23-notice) is always used to link to the source pull request rather than [references](https://common-changelog.org/#242-references), which would always reference the same pull request. References can instead link to relevant specific parts of an RFC, decision record or diff.
