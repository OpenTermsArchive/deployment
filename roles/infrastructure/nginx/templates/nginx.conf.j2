# By default, NGINX includes its version number in the response header, which
# can give potential attackers information about the software and version being
# used. This information can be useful for attackers to target specific
# vulnerabilities or exploits that are present in specific versions.
# Disabling server_tokens can help to mitigate this risk by removing the NGINX
# version number from the response headers.
